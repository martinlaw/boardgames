## Load

Here we load the data:
```{r}
games.data <- read.csv("data/games.csv")
```

## Clean

How does it look?
```{r}
head(games.data, 3)
summary(games.data)
```

Outliers in the `year` column. Remove these:

```{r}
games.data <- games.data[games.data$year < 2019, ]
```

## Analyse

Have games become better over time? Exclude games before 1900. Lots of data, so include only the games with the most ratings (top quartile):

```{r}
third.q <- summary(games.data$users_rated)["3rd Qu."]
ggplot(data=games.data[games.data$year > 1900 & games.data$users_rated > third.q, ],
       mapping = aes(x=year, y=bayes_average))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title="Board Game Ratings by Year")
```
